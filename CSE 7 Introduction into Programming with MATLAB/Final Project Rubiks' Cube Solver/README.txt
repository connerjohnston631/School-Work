This project is very dear to me, and is one that I would consider a personal
project, except that it was started and completed it within the assigned time 
for our CSE 7 Introduction into Programming with MATLAB Spring 2013 course's 
final project. While I was responsible for the logic behind the rotation 
algorithms, it wouldn't have been complete without my project parter Rachel
Kim. 

If you read this, I urge you to try it!

This program definitely works with MatLab 2014a, and may work with earlier 
versions.

To run, drag the folder into your project folders (left margin). Then open 
the project folder, and type SolveCube() in the command line. If this is 
your first time using the program, type 'y' for the first two prompts.

And, keep in mind, there are 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 ways to arrange 
a Rubik's Cube.
